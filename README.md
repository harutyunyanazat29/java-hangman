# 🔤 Java Hangman Game

A classic **Hangman** game built in Java that runs in the terminal.  
You try to guess a hidden word one letter at a time — before the stickman gets hanged!

## 🎮 How It Works

- The game randomly selects a word from a file called `words.txt`
- You guess letters one at a time
- If the letter exists in the word, it’s revealed
- If not, a part of the hangman is drawn
- You have **6 wrong attempts** before the game is over
